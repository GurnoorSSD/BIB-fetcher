# 📚 Bibtex Fetcher from DOI or Title

A Python script that automatically fetches the **BibTeX** entry for a research paper when you provide either:
- Its **DOI**, or
- Its **title** (the script will find the DOI for you).

The script detects automatically whether the clipboard content is a DOI or a title, fetches the BibTeX, **prints it**, and **copies it to your clipboard** for easy pasting into your LaTeX `.bib` file.

## ✨ Features
- 📋 **Clipboard-aware** — just copy a DOI or title, then run the script.
- 🔍 **Automatic detection** — no need to specify DOI or title; the script figures it out.
- 🌐 **CrossRef API integration** — finds the DOI if you only have the title.
- 📄 **DOI.org BibTeX fetch** — gets the BibTeX entry directly from the DOI resolver.
- ⚡ **One-step workflow** — fetch, display, and copy to clipboard in one go.
